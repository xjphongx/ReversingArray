# ReversingArray
Create a function called 'reverseArray' that receives as arguments an int array (by reference) and its size. Reverse the elements in place. 
I had to go over some pointer methods to complete the assignment.
I used pointers to reverse the array.


This is my first upload in a long time.
I am still trying to get use to it. 
I don't know anything about the git features but I will be reviewing it.
